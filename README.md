IsoDEC  (Isotropic Diffraction Elastic Constants)
Author: Thomas Gnaupel-Herold

IsoDEC is a software for the calculation of diffraction elastic constants (DEC), stress, and strain.  
It calculates bulk elastic constants for aggregates consisting of up to three phases with and without preferred orientation and for all crystal symmetries. Grain shape parameters are included in the calculations. 
The functionality for materials with preferred orientation requires a user supplied orientation distribution function (ODF) or processed EBSD data, typically as a text file output from MTEX. 
IsoDEC incorporates all relevant DEC models such as the lower/upper bound models Reuss/Voigt and Kröner/inverse Kröner as well as the geometric average, Hill type averages, and the modified Voigt model. 
Among several unique features, IsoDEC can use EBSD grain data directly and utilize the information on grain shape and neighboring grains for each orientation and (hkl) in order to calculate 
DEC using the Kröner type models. Furthermore, IsoDEC allows the fitting of single crystal elastic constants using diffraction elastic constants as input. 
Major functions of IsoDEC are demonstrated through the Demo modes in the tables “DEC/Stress/Strain” and “SC Fit”.
